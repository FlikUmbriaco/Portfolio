Repo for homework Challenge-2

As a bootcamp student, I wanted to create the backbone of my portfolio
I built this project to gain a better understanding of how flexbox elements work in CSS.
The webpage acts as a professional portfolio.
During this project, I learned about flexbox, css elements, and how to chose a color pallete :)
